# Choropleth-Map-Learnings

Two types of choropleth maps are genereted here - World map and USA map. Plotly has been used to generate the intercative maps.

Use below to install the plotly. The latest Plotly 3.1 currently is not having the support for cufflinks. Hence, I have used Plotly 2.7.

pip install plotly=2.7
